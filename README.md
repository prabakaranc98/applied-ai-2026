# applied-ai-2026
a course/compendium on applied ai in 2026 which shall cover ai from enterprise and consumer applications and problem solving point of view, experiments and optimization focused, so the learners or practitioners can get a compreheview on 1. how to approach a problem statement, 2. how to build a solution and bridge the SOTA models with the problem's constraints 3. optimization in terms of performance (empirical and systems)

## Why ? 
- Mixing too much of Research / Paper centric things with the learning path's are quite distractive for people focused in applied AI, so Let's We will take a Problem-First Approch
- If someone is Iterested in Science & Research Aspects of AI, I am doing "how to do AI Research in 2026" initiative, Where I am trying to take some interesting problems and discuss/share my findings.
